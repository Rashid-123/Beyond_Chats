## 🧠 System Architecture Overview

### 1️⃣ PDF Upload and Storage Flow
This diagram shows how a PDF uploaded by the user is securely stored in **AWS S3**, and its extracted text content is saved in **MongoDB**.

### 2️⃣ Text Chunking and Embedding Creation
Text from MongoDB is retrieved **page by page**, divided into smaller **chunks**, and converted into **vector embeddings** using the OpenAI Embeddings API for semantic search.

### 3️⃣ User Query Processing and LLM Response Generation  ( RAG based)
The user’s message is embedded and compared with **Pinecone** vectors for similarity. The most relevant context is sent to the **LLM**, which generates the final intelligent response.
